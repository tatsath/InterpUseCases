### The Science of Financial Feature Extraction

Domain-specific fine-tuning in language models creates specialized neural representations that can be extracted and analyzed to understand market dynamics. Our research demonstrates that financial fine-tuning not only affects feature representations but also creates interpretable features that correlate with market movements and price changes.

### The Research Methodology

Our analysis began with a fundamental question: **How does financial fine-tuning affect the internal representations of language models?** We employed Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract 24,576 interpretable features from both BERT and FinBERT models, enabling us to identify the specific neural patterns that emerge from financial domain training.

### Key Financial Features Identified

The analysis revealed specific features that show significant improvement in FinBERT compared to BERT, representing specialized financial intelligence:

**Top Financial Intelligence Features:**

- **Feature 7127**: "Market Movements" (436% improvement) - Advanced market pattern recognition

### Trading Strategy Implementation

These extracted features can be directly translated into quantitative trading signals. Each feature represents a specific type of financial intelligence that can be quantified and used for systematic decision-making:

1. **Earnings Surprise Detection**: Features like 9259 and 12500 identify companies likely to beat or miss earnings expectations
2. **Market Volatility Prediction**: Features like 18645 and 7127 detect impending market movements
3. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: Feature 23683 predicts stock reactions to monetary policy changes
4. **Currency Movement Anticipation**: Features like 6067 and 10912 forecast forex movements

### Systematic Trading Framework

**Step 1: Feature Activation Monitoring**
- Continuously monitor activation levels of identified financial features
- Use real-time financial news and data to trigger feature activations

**Step 2: Signal Generation**
