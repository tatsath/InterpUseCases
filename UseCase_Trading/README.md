# FinBERT SAE Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of how domain-specific fine-tuning affects feature representations in language models for financial applications. Using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we extract and analyze interpretable features from BERT and FinBERT models to understand how financial fine-tuning creates specialized features that can predict market movements and price changes.

The research demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning creates specialized features that correlate with financial market dynamics. These features, when properly identified and leveraged, can form the basis of highly effective trading strategies with exceptional backtesting performance.

## Key Findings

The analysis identified over 1,200 specialized financial features with dramatic improvements in FinBERT compared to BERT. The most significant features include market movement detection (195-436% improvement), earnings analysis (146-420% improvement), interest rate sensitivity (228% improvement), and currency/forex prediction (108-116% improvement). Financial expertise emerges primarily in the final layers, with feature overlap decreasing from 70% in early layers to 5% in Layer 11.

## Trading Performance Results

The comprehensive backtesting demonstrated exceptional performance with a 554% total return and 65% win rate. The strategy achieved a Sharpe ratio of 7.62, maximum drawdown of only 20%, Sortino ratio of 9.66, and Calmar ratio of 9.49. These results validate that AI-extracted features can form the basis of highly effective trading strategies, outperforming traditional technical and fundamental indicators.

## Pipeline Overview

The research pipeline consists of six main stages: BERT vs FinBERT SAE comparison across multiple layers, financial feature evolution analysis, LLM-based feature labeling using Qwen, comprehensive model development, backtesting framework implementation, and multi-GPU training infrastructure. The analysis processed 294,912 total features across 12 layers using 7 NVIDIA GPUs over approximately 8 hours.

## Technical Architecture

The SAE configuration uses 768 input dimensions with an expansion factor of 32, creating 24,576 features per layer. The sparsity is maintained at 192 active features per token using top-k selection with ReLU activation. The models analyzed include BERT (bert-base-uncased), FinBERT (ProsusAI/finbert), and Qwen 2.5-7B-Instruct for feature labeling.

## File Structure and Purpose

**Step 1 - BERT vs FinBERT Comparison**: `1. compare_bert_finbert_sae.py` performs comprehensive feature comparison between BERT and FinBERT models across all layers, generating detailed analysis reports and visualizations.

**Step 2 - Feature Evolution Analysis**: `2. financial_feature_evolution_analysis.py` analyzes how financial features evolve across different layers, identifying the most important features and their improvement patterns.

**Step 3 - LLM Feature Labeling**: `3. llm_feature_labeling.py` uses Qwen LLM to automatically label discovered financial features with human-interpretable descriptions, creating comprehensive feature dictionaries.

**Step 4 - Mega FinBERT Model**: `4.0 mega_finbert_model.py` creates a comprehensive model combining SAE features with traditional financial analysis, including feature importance ranking and model training.

**Step 5 - Backtesting Framework**: `5.1. finbert_backtesting.py` implements the complete backtesting framework for trading strategy evaluation, generating performance metrics and risk analysis reports.

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that FinBERT's financial specialization is subtle but significant, with the most important features emerging in the final layers. The discovered features show strong potential for financial applications, with some features showing 100-400% improvement in financial understanding compared to base BERT. The pipeline provides a complete framework for analyzing domain-specific language model features and can be extended to other domains and model architectures.
