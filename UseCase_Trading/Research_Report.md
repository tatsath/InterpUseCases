Different financial categories showed varying degrees of specialization:
- **Derivatives/Options**: 287.95% maximum improvement (Feature 10370, Layer 9)
- **Earnings Analysis**: 334.70% maximum improvement (Feature 8188, Layer 10)
- **Credit Lending**: 296.32% maximum improvement (Feature 15496, Layer 9)
- **Market Movements**: 346.46% maximum improvement (Feature 18645, Layer 11)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis reveals that domain-specific fine-tuning creates subtle but significant specializations in language model features.

3. **Discovered features are interpretable** and correspond to financial concepts
4. **Features have practical value** in financial prediction and analysis

The methodology provides a framework for understanding domain adaptation in language models and opens new possibilities for interpretable AI in financial applications. The discovered features show strong potential for practical applications in trading, risk management, and financial analysis.

The research contributes to both theoretical understanding of transformer model behavior and practical applications in financial technology, demonstrating that interpretable AI can provide valuable insights for domain-specific applications.
