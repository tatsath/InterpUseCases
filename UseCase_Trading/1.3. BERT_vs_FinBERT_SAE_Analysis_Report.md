# BERT vs FinBERT SAE Comprehensive Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive comparison between Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features extracted from BERT (bert-base-uncased) and FinBERT (ProsusAI/finbert) models. The analysis covers three layers (0, 6, and 11) and reveals fascinating insights about how domain-specific fine-tuning affects feature representations.

### Key Findings
- **Overall Similarity**: 90-99% similarity across all layers
- **Financial Specialization**: FinBERT shows 1-4% additional financial focus
- **Layer-wise Divergence**: Specialization increases in deeper layers
- **Feature Overlap**: Decreases from 70% (Layer 0) to 5% (Layer 11)

### Where the "4% Additional Financial Features" Comes From
The **4% figure** refers to the **maximum financial specialization increase** observed across all layers and categories:

1. **Layer 0**: 2.1% overall increase
2. **Layer 6**: 0.4% overall increase  
3. **Layer 11**: 1.2% overall increase
4. **Category-specific peaks**: Up to 4.6% increase in Banking Lending (Layer 11)

## Financial Specialization Calculation Methodology

### Step 1: Feature Response Collection
For each feature in both models, we calculate activation scores across all financial categories:

```python
financial_categories = ['financial_terms', 'financial_sentiment', 'corporate_finance', 
                       'banking_lending', 'investment_trading']

# For each feature, sum activations across financial categories
bert_financial_score = sum(feature_responses_bert[feature_idx].get(cat, 0) 
                          for cat in financial_categories)
finbert_financial_score = sum(feature_responses_finbert[feature_idx].get(cat, 0) 
                             for cat in financial_categories)
```

### Step 2: Average Score Calculation
```python
bert_avg_financial = np.mean(bert_financial_scores)
finbert_avg_financial = np.mean(finbert_financial_scores)
```

### Step 3: Specialization Ratio
```python
financial_specialization_ratio = finbert_avg_financial / bert_avg_financial
percentage_increase = (financial_specialization_ratio - 1) × 100
```

### Example Calculation (Layer 0)
```
BERT Average Financial Score: 0.6521
FinBERT Average Financial Score: 0.6657
Ratio: 0.6657 / 0.6521 = 1.021
Percentage Increase: (1.021 - 1) × 100 = 2.1%
```

## Statistical Significance

### Correlation Analysis
| Layer | Financial Score Correlation | Interpretation |
|-------|------------------------------|----------------|
| 0 | 97.15% | Very strong correlation |
| 6 | 94.52% | Strong correlation |
| 11 | 69.52% | Moderate correlation |

### Feature Overlap Significance
- **Layer 0**: 70% overlap suggests shared foundational features
- **Layer 6**: 50% overlap indicates moderate specialization
- **Layer 11**: 5% overlap shows significant domain divergence

---

## Implications and Conclusions

### 1. **Modest Financial Specialization**
Despite being fine-tuned on financial data, FinBERT shows only 1-4% additional financial specialization in SAE features. This suggests:
- Financial fine-tuning affects feature representations subtly
- Core language understanding remains largely preserved
- Specialization occurs primarily in feature activation patterns, not structure

### 2. **Layer-wise Specialization Pattern**
- **Early layers (0)**: High similarity with moderate financial gains
- **Middle layers (6)**: Continued similarity with minimal financial gains
- **Final layers (11)**: Reduced similarity with variable financial gains

### 3. **Feature Overlap Decline**
The dramatic decrease in feature overlap (70% → 5%) suggests:
- Early layers maintain shared representations
- Deeper layers develop domain-specific features
- FinBERT's financial expertise emerges primarily in final processing stages

### 4. **Category-specific Insights**
- **Financial Sentiment**: Most consistent improvement across layers
- **Banking Lending**: Strongest specialization in final layers
- **Investment Trading**: Variable performance across layers
