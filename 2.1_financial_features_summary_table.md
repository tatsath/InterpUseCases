## Emerging Financial Features (New in FinBERT)

These features were not in the top 20 financial features for BERT but emerged as top financial features in FinBERT:

## What Happened During Fine-tuning

### Key Insights:

1. **Massive Feature Evolution**: 75% of the top 20 financial features in FinBERT were NOT in BERT's top 20, showing dramatic feature repurposing.

2. **Dramatic Improvements**: Some features showed incredible improvements:
   - Feature 127: 189.90% improvement in financial activation
   - Feature 115: 361.94% improvement in financial activation
   - Feature 59: 426.09% improvement in financial activation

3. **Feature Repurposing**: Many "General" features in BERT became "FinBERT Financial" features, indicating that fine-tuning doesn't create new neurons but reassigns existing ones.

4. **Consistent Features**: Only 2 features (65, 34) remained consistently in the top financial features across both models.

5. **Score Improvements**: Overall scores also improved dramatically, with some features showing 400%+ improvements in their overall activation scores.

### What This Means:

- **Domain Adaptation**: FinBERT successfully adapted its internal representations to better handle financial text
- **Feature Repurposing**: Rather than creating new features, FinBERT repurposed existing features for financial tasks
- **Specialization**: Features that were general-purpose in BERT became specialized for financial content in FinBERT
- **Efficiency**: The model achieved better financial performance by optimizing existing computational resources rather than adding new ones

This analysis shows that fine-tuning is primarily about **feature repurposing and optimization** rather than creating entirely new computational units.
